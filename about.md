   Hello!! My name is Lia and I'm mostly interested on end-to-end automation of machine learning workflow, interactive data visualization and data analysis. 
   
   I'm a statistician &#10084; with working experience mostly with data analysis and deployment of online and batch machine learning models.
   
   Nowadays I'm living in Lausanne and pursuing a master's degree at [EPFL](https://ic.epfl.ch/computer-science).
   
   If you have any comments, feedbacks and questions, just drop me an [email](liamarciavbifano@gmail.com).
