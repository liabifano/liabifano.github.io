   My name is Lia, I'm statistician, I live in Lausanne and nowadays I pursue a master's degree at [EPFL](https://ic.epfl.ch/computer-science).         

   My main interest is to apply Python, JavaScript and Scala to analyse and visualize data. In this space I would like to show analysis of cool and "free" datasets.
   
   As I'm writing about things that I find interesting and have just learnt, don't hesitate about point out mistakes.
   If you have any comments or questions, just send me an [email](lia.bifano@gmail.com) ðŸ˜‰
